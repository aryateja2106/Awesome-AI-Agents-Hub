# Building Your Own AI Research Agent: Tools and Architecture

---

## Introduction

AI agents are transforming how we interact with data, automate tasks, and enhance knowledge workflows. From handling routine activities to performing advanced research, AI agents are empowering users with tools to understand, search, and analyze information.

In this blog, we will:

- Understand **what an AI agent is**.
- Break down **the key parts of an AI agent architecture**.
- Explore **applications of AI agents**.
- Guide you through **building your own AI research agent**.
- Explain the **AI tech stack** and provide tools for each layer.

Let's dive in!

## What is an AI Agent?

An **AI agent** is a system that interacts with its environment (through inputs and outputs) to perform specific tasks autonomously or with minimal human intervention. Agents can:

1. **Understand user intent**.
2. **Plan** tasks to achieve goals.
3. **Search** and gather relevant information.
4. **Reflect and improve** responses.
5. **Take actions** using tools or APIs.

### Key Components:

1. **Memory**
    - Manages short-term and long-term data storage. Typically could be personal data in this case things like topics you are interested, what articles you liked before etc.
    - Enables agents to retain context and learn from past interactions.
    - Example tools: [LangGraph Memory](https://python.langchain.com/docs/versions/migrating_memory/), [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/).
2. **Tools**
    - External functions or APIs agents can use to perform tasks.
    - Examples include:
        - **Calendar()**: For scheduling tasks.
        - **Calculator()**: Performing mathematical operations.
        - **CodeInterpreter()**: Analyzing and running code.
        - **Search()**: Searching information online.
        - arXiv API(): From particular source, or bunch or sources (like a student like to read research paper they can use arxiv api)
    - Example libraries: [OpenAI's Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling), [LangChain tool calling](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/tool_calling/), [Composio tools](https://composio.dev/)
3. **Planning**
    - Breaks tasks into actionable steps.
    - Techniques:
        - **Reflection**: Review outputs to improve performance.
        - **Self-critics**: Identifying and correcting errors.
        - **Chain of Thought**: Reasoning step by step.
        - **Subgoal Decomposition**: Dividing complex tasks into smaller, achievable steps.
    - Example tools: [LangGraph](https://blog.langchain.dev/planning-for-agents/), [ReAct](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/react/).
4. **Action**
    - Executes the planned tasks using tools and APIs.
    - Performing a single or multiple steps autonomously
    - Example: Calling an external API to fetch data or generate a report.
    - Example: [Claude artifacts](https://www.anthropic.com/news/artifacts), [OpenAI Canvas](https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/)

## Applications of AI Agents

AI agents are solving real-world challenges and unlocking new potential in knowledge work. Common use cases include:

1. **Performing Research and Summarization** (58% adoption)
    - Example: AI tools that search research papers, summarize content, and gather references.
2. **Personal Productivity or Assistance** (53.5%)
    - Example: Calendar assistants, task automation tools, and note summarizers.

### Recent AI Agent Innovations

- **LangChain's LangGraph**: A framework that allows building AI agents capable of understanding intent and performing multi-step reasoning.
- **Google Gemini's Deep Research Mode**: Helps users find relevant topics, gather detailed data, and write reports interactively. [check it out here](https://youtu.be/_mpD0dDL66g?si=brpWrajrvD-VqO4L).
- **ChatGPT Search GPT**: GPT-4o performs searches on behalf of users and provides results with references. [check it out here](https://www.youtube.com/live/OzgNJJ2ErEE?si=ShXvnV8fDXPDAHkD)

These examples show the growing trend of **personalized research assistants**.
